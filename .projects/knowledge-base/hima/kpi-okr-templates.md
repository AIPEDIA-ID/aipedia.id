## OKR Best Practices

### Setting OKRs
1. **Objectives** should be:
   - Qualitative and inspirational
   - Time-bound (usually quarterly)
   - Actionable and ambitious
   - Aligned with company goals

2. **Key Results** should be:
   - Quantitative and measurable
   - 3-5 per objective
   - Outcome-focused, not output-focused
   - Achievable but challenging

### Common Mistakes
- Setting too many OKRs (stick to 3-5 objectives)
- Making OKRs too easy (aim for 60-70% achievement)
- Confusing OKRs with tasks (OKRs measure outcomes)
- Not tracking progress weekly
- Setting OKRs in isolation (cascade from company to team to individual)

### OKR Tracking Template

| OKR | Progress | Status | Owner |
|-----|----------|--------|-------|
| Objective 1 - KR1 | 50% | On Track | [Name] |
| Objective 1 - KR2 | 30% | At Risk | [Name] |
| Objective 1 - KR3 | 70% | On Track | [Name] |
| Objective 2 - KR1 | 0% | Not Started | [Name] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Status:** On Track | At Risk | Off Track | Completed | Not Started
