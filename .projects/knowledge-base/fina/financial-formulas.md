## Liquidity Ratios

### Current Ratio
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```

**Interpretasi:**
- > 2.0: Sangat sehat
- 1.5 - 2.0: Sehat
- 1.0 - 1.5: Perlu perhatian
- < 1.0: Berisiko

### Quick Ratio (Acid Test)
```
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
```

**Interpretasi:**
- > 1.0: Sehat
- 0.8 - 1.0: Perlu perhatian
- < 0.8: Berisiko

## Efficiency Ratios

### Asset Turnover Ratio
```
Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
```

### Inventory Turnover
```
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
```

### Inventory Days
```
Inventory Days = 365 / Inventory Turnover
```

### Receivables Turnover
```
Receivables Turnover = Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
```

### Receivables Collection Period
```
Collection Period = 365 / Receivables Turnover
```

### Payables Turnover
```
Payables Turnover = COGS / Average Accounts Payable
```

### Payables Payment Period
```
Payment Period = 365 / Payables Turnover
```

---

## Solvency Ratios

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities / Shareholder's Equity
```

**Interpretasi:**
- < 0.5: Sangat konservatif
- 0.5 - 1.0: Moderat
- 1.0 - 2.0: Agresif
- > 2.0: Berisiko tinggi

### Debt Ratio
```
Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets × 100%
```

### Equity Ratio
```
Equity Ratio = Shareholder's Equity / Total Assets × 100%
```

### Interest Coverage Ratio
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
```

**Interpretasi:**
- > 3.0: Sangat aman
- 1.5 - 3.0: Aman
- < 1.5: Berisiko
- < 1.0: Sangat berisiko

## Working Capital Management

### Net Working Capital
```
Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
```

### Working Capital Requirement
```
WCR = (Inventory + Receivables) - Payables
```

---

## Cost Analysis

### Variable Cost per Unit
```
Variable Cost per Unit = Total Variable Costs / Total Units Produced
```

### Fixed Cost per Unit
```
Fixed Cost per Unit = Total Fixed Costs / Total Units Produced
```

### Total Cost
```
Total Cost = Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost per Unit × Units Produced)
```

---

## Depreciation Methods

### Straight-Line Depreciation
```
Annual Depreciation = (Asset Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
```

### Double-Declining Balance
```
Annual Depreciation = (2 / Useful Life) × Book Value at Beginning of Year
```

### Units of Production
```
Depreciation per Unit = (Asset Cost - Salvage Value) / Total Estimated Units
Annual Depreciation = Depreciation per Unit × Units Produced
```

---

## Time Value of Money

### Future Value (FV)
```
FV = PV × (1 + r)^n
```
- PV = Present Value
- r = Interest rate
- n = Number of periods

### Present Value (PV)
```
PV = FV / (1 + r)^n
```

### Annuity Future Value
```
FV Annuity = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r
```
- PMT = Payment per period

### Annuity Present Value
```
PV Annuity = PMT × [1 - (1 + r)^(-n)] / r
```

---

## Pricing & Cost-Plus Pricing

### Cost-Plus Pricing
```
Selling Price = Total Cost per Unit + (Total Cost per Unit × Markup %)
```

### Markup Percentage
```
Markup % = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost × 100%
```

### Gross Margin Percentage
```
Gross Margin % = (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price × 100%
```

---

## Inventory Valuation

### Weighted Average Cost
```
Weighted Average Cost = Total Cost of Goods Available / Total Units Available
```

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
```
EOQ = √[(2 × Annual Demand × Ordering Cost) / Holding Cost per Unit]
```

---

## Profit Analysis

### Gross Profit
```
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
```

### Operating Profit (EBIT)
```
Operating Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
```

### Net Profit
```
Net Profit = Operating Profit - Interest Expense - Taxes
```

### EBITDA

EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization
```

---

## Growth Rates

### Revenue Growth Rate
```
Growth Rate = [(Current Revenue - Previous Revenue) / Previous Revenue] × 100%
